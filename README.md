# Complete Microservices Project with Spring Boot

## Overview

This repository contains a comprehensive microservices project developed using Java, Spring Boot, and related technologies. The project is designed to showcase the implementation of a microservices architecture and the management of production-ready services.

## Technologies Used

- **Java**: Programming language for developing the backend services.
- **Spring Boot**: Framework for building and deploying microservices.
- **Spring Cloud**: Tools for microservices architecture, including service discovery, configuration management, and more.
- **Docker**: Containerization technology for packaging and deploying microservices.
- **Kubernetes**: Container orchestration for managing and scaling services.
- **Helm**: Package manager for Kubernetes, used for deploying applications.
- **Resilience4j**: Library for building resilient microservices.
- **Prometheus**: Monitoring and alerting toolkit.
- **Loki**: Log aggregation system.
- **Promtail**: Agent for gathering and shipping logs to Loki.
- **Tempo**: Distributed tracing system.
- **Grafana**: Dashboard and visualization tool.
- **RabbitMQ/Kafka**: Message brokers for event-driven architecture.
- **OAuth2/OpenID Connect**: Security frameworks for authentication and authorization.

## Project Description

This project is developed as part of a learning journey to understand and implement microservices architecture. The development process follows concepts and practices related to:

- **Microservices Architecture**: Understanding how microservices differ from monolithic and SOA architectures.
- **Spring Boot & Spring Cloud**: Building production-ready microservices using these frameworks.
- **Documentation**: Using Open API Specification and Swagger for documenting the microservices.
- **Configuration Management**: Managing configurations with Spring Cloud Config Server.
- **Service Discovery**: Implementing service discovery and registration with Spring Eureka Server.
- **Resilience**: Building resilient services using Resilience4j.
- **Observability**: Implementing monitoring and logging with Prometheus, Loki, Promtail, Tempo, and Grafana.
- **Security**: Securing microservices with OAuth2, OpenID Connect, and Spring Security.
- **Event-Driven Architecture**: Using RabbitMQ and Kafka for event-driven communication.
- **Containerization & Orchestration**: Using Docker and Kubernetes for container management and orchestration.
- **Deployment**: Using Helm for deploying microservices to Kubernetes.
