# Complete Microservices Project with Spring Boot

## Overview

This repository will host a comprehensive microservices project developed using Java, Spring Boot, and related technologies. The goal of this project is to implement and showcase a microservices architecture with a focus on best practices and production readiness.

## Planned Technologies

- **Java**: The primary programming language for backend services.
- **Spring Boot**: Framework for developing and deploying microservices.
- **Spring Cloud**: For microservices architecture components such as service discovery, configuration management, etc.
- **Docker**: To containerize microservices for consistent environments.
- **Kubernetes**: To orchestrate containers and manage service scaling.
- **Helm**: To package and deploy applications on Kubernetes.
- **Resilience4j**: For building resilient microservices with features like circuit breakers.
- **Prometheus**: For monitoring and alerting.
- **Loki**: For log aggregation.
- **Promtail**: To collect and ship logs to Loki.
- **Tempo**: For distributed tracing.
- **Grafana**: For creating dashboards and visualizations.
- **RabbitMQ/Kafka**: For event-driven communication between services.
- **OAuth2/OpenID Connect**: For securing microservices with authentication and authorization.

## Planned Project Infrastructure

1. **Microservices Architecture**: Implementation of a microservices architecture with separate services for different functionalities, enabling scalability and flexibility.
2. **Service Discovery**: Using Spring Eureka Server to enable services to find and communicate with each other.
3. **Configuration Management**: Implementing centralized configuration management using Spring Cloud Config Server.
4. **API Documentation**: Documenting microservices using Open API Specification and Swagger.
5. **Resilience Patterns**: Utilizing Resilience4j for handling failures and building resilient services.
6. **Observability**: Setting up monitoring and logging with Prometheus, Loki, Promtail, Tempo, and Grafana.
7. **Security**: Implementing security best practices with OAuth2, OpenID Connect, and Spring Security.
8. **Event-Driven Architecture**: Using RabbitMQ and Kafka for handling asynchronous communication between services.
9. **Containerization**: Containerizing microservices using Docker to ensure consistent environments across development and production.
10. **Orchestration**: Managing and scaling containers with Kubernetes.
11. **Deployment**: Using Helm for deploying and managing microservices on Kubernetes.
